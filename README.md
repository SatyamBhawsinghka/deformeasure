This is a software package to measure deformation from images or frames from videos using Digital Image Correlation(DIC). 
Another capability is to create deformed images and videos using cairo. 
The package provides a command line interface which demonstrates the capabilities of measuring deformation from either images or videos and creating visualisations and storing the output in a csv file.
